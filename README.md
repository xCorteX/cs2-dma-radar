> If you just want to use the radar, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/rabume/cs2-dma-radar/releases)
> Requirements to run latest release: [JDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk&version=21)

## 🚀 Usage

After you complied or downloaded the latest release, you can start the radar with the following command:

```bash
java -jar CS2DMA-1.2.2.jar
```

Then you should be able to access the radar at http://localhost:8080

## ⚡️ Requirements

**Hardware:**

- DMA card -> Only tested with [Screamer PCIe Squirrel](https://shop.lambdaconcept.com/home/50-screamer-pcie-squirrel.html)

**Software:**

- Nodejs (>= 20.3.0) -> Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or directly install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Java Development Kit (>= 21) -> [Download](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk&version=21)
- Apache Maven (>= 3.8.7) -> [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Make (>= GNU Make 4.4.1) -> Use cygwin or install make directly: [Download](https://www.cygwin.com/)

#### 🚨 Note

Only tested on Windows. The release provides the necessary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). To run on Linux, you need to obtain
the Shared Object (.so) files yourself and replace the ones in the release directory. Also the paths have to be adjusted.

**Client still has to run Windows!**

The required files are:

- [leechcore.so](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore/releases)
- [vmm.so](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/releases)
- [FTD3XX.so](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d3xx-drivers/)

## 📡 Share radar

To share the radar with your friends, you have to forward the port 8080 on your router to your local machine.
Then you can share your public IP address with your friends.

Alternatively, you can use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to share your radar.

## 🛠️ Build

1. Install frontend dependencies: `cd client && npm i`
2. Move back to the root directory: `cd ..`
3. Build application: `make build`
4. Move to the release directory: `cd release`
5. Start the application: `java -jar CS2DMA-1.2.0.jar`

## Offsets

The offsets are stored in a file called `offsets.json` in the root directory of the application.
To get the latest offsets you can use the [cs2-dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper) by a2x.
If you don't want to dump them yourself, you can use the offsets from [offsets.rs](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/blob/main/output/offsets.rs) and [client.dll.hpp](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/blob/main/output/client.dll.hpp).
